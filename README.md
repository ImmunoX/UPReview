# UPReview
# This repository simply houses a Teaching Deck used to teach and share information about the process of
# Scientific Peer review.    It is open to the public to download the .ppt for use but also serves as a 
# site for upload of modified decks containing additional information or modifications.
# From time to time, the community may be polled to trunk any variations.
# Email immunoX@ucsf.edu if you wish to contribute additional resources.
