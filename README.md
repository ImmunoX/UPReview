# Universal Principled Review
This repository simply houses a Slide Deck that can be used to teach and share 
information regarding the process of Scientific Peer review. 

`UP Review_Teaching.pptx` is free-to-use by the public at any time for private use 
and for teaching purposes. Modifications to the slide deck are welcome in the form 
of pull requests from a forked repository.

From time to time, the community may be polled to trunk any variations.
